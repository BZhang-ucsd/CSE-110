Hi, this is Botao Zhang, a second-year transfer student who is majoring in Computer Science at UCSD.

**As a programmer**: I like to play around with different programming language such as java, c, c++ and python.
**AS a person**: ~~I sleep all the time~~ I enjoy video gaming, workouts and basketball during free time.
One quote I like to say:
> It is what it is.

I am really not familiar with github, so I guess I have to learn throughout the quarter.
