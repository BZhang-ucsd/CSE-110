## About me
Hi, this is Botao Zhang, a second-year transfer student who is majoring in Computer Science at UCSD.

**As a programmer**: I like to play around with different programming language such as:
- java
- c
- c++ 
- python.

**AS a person**: ~~I sleep all the time~~ Here what I do in my free time(sort by favorite)
1. basketball
2. video gaming
3. workouts

The first quote I learn for programming is:

> Hello World

Or in C you can say:
```
printf("Hello, World!");
```

I am really not familiar with github, so I have to search tutorials doing the first lab.

Here is one of the video I searched for how to create a .gitignore:
[HOW TO USE GITIGNORE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmGW45eZOg8&ab_channel=Magnitopic)

### What is my favorite Programming Language?
Here is a code for my [favorite language](HelloWorld.c)

In CSE 110, I hope I can be able to:
- [] Become a better programmer
- [] Become a good communicator
- [] Learn about the process of developing software
- [] Get familiar with team based software development
