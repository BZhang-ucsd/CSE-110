Or in C you can say:
```
printf("Hello, World!");

## About CSE 110

I am really not familiar with github, so I have to search tutorials doing the first lab.

Here is one of the video I searched for how to create a .gitignore:
[HOW TO USE GITIGNORE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmGW45eZOg8&ab_channel=Magnitopic)

In CSE 110, I hope I can be able to:
- [ ] Become a better programmer
- [ ] Become a good communicator
- [ ] Learn about the process of developing software
- [ ] Get familiar with team based software development

Current Lab Progress:
- [x] Lab 1 VSCode, Markdown, and Git Part 1
- [ ] Lab 2
- [ ] Lab 3
- [ ] Lab 4
- [ ] Lab 5

I will keep it update!
