## About me

Hi, this is Botao Zhang, a second-year transfer student who is majoring in Computer Science at UCSD.

**As a programmer**: I like to play around with different programming language such as java, c, c++ and python.

**AS a person**: ~~I sleep all the time~~ I enjoy video gaming, workouts and basketball during free time.

The first quote I learn for programming is:

> Hello World

Or in C you can say:
```
printf("Hello, World!");
```

I am really not familiar with github, so I have to search tutorials doing the first lab.

Here is one of the video I searched to learn how to create a .gitignore:
